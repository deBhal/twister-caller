# twister-caller

A minimal Clojure "application" for windows to call the twister game.  Right foot red! Left hand yellow!

It uses the Jampal mp3 library: http://jampal.sourceforge.net/ptts.html

I threw this together so I could play twister with my kids.  Naturally, this
took too long the first time, but it worked the second time around, so I
thought I'd throw it up on github.

## Usage

cd twister-caller
lein run
ctrl-c ctrl-c
